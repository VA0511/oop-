- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows one interface to represent multiple forms, promoting flexibility and reusability. It simplifies code maintenance, enables method overriding and overloading, and supports dynamic method dispatch for runtime behavior.

- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
Inheritance enables polymorphism by allowing a subclass to inherit methods from a superclass. Through method overriding, a subclass can provide its own implementation of a method, and a superclass reference can call the subclass's method at runtime (dynamic polymorphism).

- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
+ Polymorphism: Focuses on allowing objects to take multiple forms (e.g., method overriding, overloading). It’s a behavior that enables flexibility in method calls.  
+ Inheritance: A mechanism where a class inherits properties and methods from another class. It’s a structural relationship that supports polymorphism but is primarily about code reuse and hierarchy.
